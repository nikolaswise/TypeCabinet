\f0\fs24 \cf0 TypeCabinet\
Traditional Typesetting for Digital Publication\
\
TypeCabinet is a SASS module for managing typography with web projects - or any application that uses HTML and CSS to design type. While there are a lot of fantastic tools out there right now like Typecast and TypeKit and the like, these take a perspective on typography informed by professional web designers. The approach I'm taking with TypeCabinet is informed by traditional hand-set letterpress printing, and principles of type and page layout existed far longer than the web of desktop publishing. A key theory in TypeCabinet is pixel independence. I define a baseline relative unit, and from there move into Picas and Points - combining the best functionalities of both print and web units.\
\
TypeCabinet works by defining the three distinct elements of a font: Typeface, Weight, and Point Size separately, and using SASS mixins to combine these into cabinets and cases like those use in a letterpress shop. For example, the subtitle to this section is simply defined as DinMedium30Point, with the options to change case, tracking, and leading as needed. \
